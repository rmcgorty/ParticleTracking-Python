    # based on the IDL routine written by John C. Crocker and David G. Grier
    # but now with SUBPIXEL RESOLUTION IN 3D implemented fully.   
    
    # varargin should contain input for [ separation, masscut, threshold,threwhold], 
    # and whether there is input for it or not indicated in the logical input for
    # inputv. inputv contains 4 logical input, for example [0,1,0,1].

    # Feature3D
    # PURPOSE:
    # Finds and measures roughly spheroidal 'features' within 
    # a 3d image. Although original 3d codes worked best with dilute or 
    # separate features, this code is designed to handle dense systems as well. 
    
    # CATEGORY:
    # 		Image Processing
    #  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    # 		f = feature3d( image, diameter ,separation, masscut, threshold )
    #  INPUTS:
    # 		image:	(nx,ny,nz) array which presumably contains some
    # 			features worth finding
    # 		diameter: a parameter which should be a little greater than
    # 			the diameter of the largest features in the image.
    # 			May be a single float number if the image is 
    # 			isotropic, a 3-vector otherwise.
    # 		separation: an optional parameter which specifies the 
    # 			minimum allowable separation between feature 
    # 			centers. The default value is diameter-1.
    # 		masscut: Setting this parameter saves runtime by reducing
    # 			the runtime wasted on low mass 'noise' features.
    # 		threshold: Set this parameter to a number less than 1 to
    # 			threshold each particle image by 
    # 			(peak height)*(threshold).  Reduces pixel biasing
    # 			with an particle specific threshold.
    #  OUTPUTS:
    # 		f(:,1):	this contains the x centroid positions, in pixels.
    # 		f(:,2): this contains the y centroid positions, in pixels. 
    # 		f(:,3): this contains the z centroid positions, in pixels.
    # 		f(:,4): this contains the integrated brightness.
    # 		f(:,5): this contains the squared radius of gyration. 
    # 		f(:,6): this contains the peak height of the feature.
    # 		f(:,7): this contains the fraction of voxels above threshold.
    # 
    #  SIDE EFFECTS:
    # 		Displays the number of features found on the screen.
    #  RESTRICTIONS:
    # 		To work properly, the image must consist of bright, 
    # 		smooth regions on a roughly zero-valued background. 
    # 		To find dark features, the image should be 
    # 		inverted and the background subtracted. If the image
    # 		contains a large amount of high spatial frequency noise,
    # 		performance will be improved by first filtering the image.
    # 		'bpass3d' will remove high spatial frequency noise, and 
    # 		subtract the image background and thus may provides a useful 
    # 		complement to using this program. Individual features 
    # 		should NOT overlap or touch.  Furthermore, the maximum
    # 		value of the top of the feature must be in the top 30th
    # 		percentile of brightness in the entire image.
    # 		For images where the particles are close packed, the
    # 		system of bpass3d/feature3d is not ideal, but will give
    # 		rough coordinates.  We often find setting 'sep' to roughly
    # 	diameter/2 seems helpful to avoid particle loss.
    #  PROCEDURE:
    # 		First, identify the positions of all the local maxima in
    # 		the image ( defined in a circular neighborhood with radius
    # 		equal to 'separation' ). Around each of these maxima, place a 
    # 		circular mask, of diameter 'diameter', and calculate the x,y,z
    #     	centroids, the total of all the pixel values.
    # 		If the restrictions above are adhered to, and the features 
    # 		are more than about 5 pixels across, the resulting x 
    # 		and y values will have errors of order 0.1 pixels for 
    # 		reasonably noise free images.
    # 		If 'threshold' is set, then the image within the mask is 
    # 		thresholded to a value of the peak height*threshold.  This
    # 		is useful when sphere images are connected by faint bridges
    # 		which can cause pixel biasing.
    # 
    #  *********	       READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT CAVEAT!        **********
    # 		'feature3d' is capable of finding image features with sub-pixel
    # 		accuracy, but only if used correctly- that is, if the 
    # 		background is subtracted off properly and the centroid mask 
    # 		is larger than the feature, so that clipping does not occur.
    # 		It is an EXCELLENT idea when working with new data to plot
    # 		a histogram of the x-positions mod 1, that is, of the
    # 		fractional part of x in pixels.  If the resulting histogram
    # 		is flat, then you're ok, if its strongly peaked, then you're
    # 		doing something wrong- but probably still getting 'nearest
    # 		pixel' accuracy.
    # 
    # 		For a more quantitative treatment of sub-pixel position 
    # 		resolution see: 
    # 		J.C. Crocker and D.G. Grier, J. Colloid Interface Sci.

    #  MODIFICATION HISTORY:
    # 		This code is inspired by feature_stats2 written by
    # 			David G. Grier, U of Chicago, 			 1992.
    # 		Generalized version of feature.pro			 1998.
    # 		Improved local maximum routine, from fcp3d		 1999.
    # 		Added 'threshold' keyword to reduce pixel biasing.	 1999.
    # 		
    #	The code feature3d.pro was copyrighted 1999, John C. Crocker and 
    #	David G. Grier.  It should be considered 'freeware'- and may be
    #	distributed freely in its original form when properly attributed.
    #   We continue the same philosophy for feature3dMB.m . (Yongxiang Gao and 
    #   Maria Kilfoil)

    #   # produce a 3d, anisotropic parabolic mask
    # 	anisotropic masks are 'referenced' to the x-axis scale.
    # 	ratios less than one squash the thing relative to 'x'
    # 	using float ratios allows precise 'diameter' settings 
    # 	in an odd-sized mask.
    
    #  For anisotropy, make diameter a 3-vector, otherwise one # is ok.
    #  Image should consist of smooth well separated peaks on a zero
    #  or near zero background, with diameter set somewhat larger
    #  than the diameter of the peak!
